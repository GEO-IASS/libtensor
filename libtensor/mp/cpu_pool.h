/** \brief Manages a pool of CPUs

    The CPU pool maintains a list of available processors and allocates them
    for specific computational tasks.

    acquire_cpu() is a locking method that allocates one CPU from the pool. If
    there are no free CPUs at the time of the call, it waits until a CPU becomes
    available. The CPU is acquired for a specific computation by the calling
    thread, which makes it unavailable for other threads until it is released
    back to the pool.

    release_cpu() returns a previously acquired CPU back to the pool.

    The CPU pool controls the flow such that the number of active threads
    doesn't exceed the total number of available CPUs.
